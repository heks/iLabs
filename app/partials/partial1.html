<strong>What is this lab about?</strong>

<p>In this lab, you can investigate the intensity of radiation over distance using a radioactive strontium-90 sample and a Geiger counter, which is an instrument used to measure radioactive radiation.</p>


<strong>How does the lab equipment work?</strong>

<p>As the strontium-90 sample decays, it emits radioactive beta particles. The Geiger counter detects the number of radioactive particles that are present at a given distance from the strontium-90 source. This equipment is located at the University of Queensland in Australia. Click on the webcam to see this equipment live in Australia.</p>


<strong>What can I do in this lab?</strong>

<p>Following the cycle of steps below, you can investigate how radiation changes over distance by collecting measurements of radiation at different distances from the source of radiation (strontium-90). Mouse over the steps below to find out more about each step of the lab. When you're ready to begin the lab, click Start below.</p>

<strong>What is this lab about?</strong>

<p>In this lab, you can investigate the use of powder X-ray diffraction technique to study the crystalline lattice structure of Silicone sample.</p>


<strong>How does the lab equipment work?</strong>

 <p>X-ray diffractometers consist of three basic elements: an X-ray tube, a sample holder, and an X-ray detector. X-rays are generated in a cathode ray tube by heating a filament to produce electrons, accelerating the electrons toward a target by applying a voltage, and bombarding the target material with electrons. When electrons have sufficient energy to dislodge inner shell electrons of the target material, characteristic X-ray spectra are produced.  These X-rays are collimated and directed onto the sample. As the sample and detector are rotated, the intensity of the reflected X-rays is recorded. When the geometry of the incident X-rays impinging the sample satisfies the Bragg Equation, constructive interference occurs and a peak in intensity occurs. A detector records and processes this X-ray signal and converts the signal to a count rate which is then output to a device such as a printer or computer monitor. This equipment is located at the Jerome B. Cohen X-ray Diffraction Facility at Northwestern University Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (NU-MRSEC). </p>
